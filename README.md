## What is FracNut
**FracNut** is a fraction calculator, that is, to calculate the fractions, such as 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12.

Therefore, you are able to type **fractions** (using [a/b] form to represent a fraction a/b) as well as **mathematical expressions** in the program, and the program will return you a simplified fraction.

**For example,**

Input[1]: [1/3]+1/4 \
Output[1]: 7/12

Input[2]: 0.5 \
Output[2]: 1/2

Input[3]: (3+4)/7 \
Output[3]: 1

**In addition**, there are several commands you can use, they are,

_decimal()_ for converting an expression into decimal form (default outputs are fractions);

_lastResult()_ for calling the last calculated result (either fraction result or decimal result);

_clipboard()_ for calling the program built-in clipboard, it is for you to save the calculation result and you can use it later;

_copy()_ for copying the last result into the program built-in clipboard.

Please run the program and use _help()_ for more detailed instructions.
